When you use frameset you split the visual real estate of a browser window into multiple frames. Each frame has it’s own contents and the content in one don’t spill into the next.<br>

An iframe, on the other hand, embeds a frame directly inline with the other elements of a webpage.<br>

While both frames and iframes perform a similar function – embedding a resource into a webpage – they are fundamentally different.
<br>
Frames are layout-defining elements.<br>
Iframes are a content-adding elements.
